<h1>History of JMLR</h1>
<p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">JMLR was founded (incorporated as a non-profit) in 2000 by Leslie Kaelbling, Computer Science Professor at MIT, with the goal of starting a new journal in the area of machine learning whose contents are freely available to the research community at large via the web. Inspired by Steve Minton's founding of JAIR, Leslie assembled a founding team, and with the operational help of David Cohn, version 0 of the jmlr web site was up and running on www.jmlr.org on June 23, 2000. At ICML shortly thereafter, MIT Press, who had agreed to do the printed copies of JMLR, were handing out flyers announcing the journal (it turned out later that MIT Press were losing too much money on JMLR, leading to termination of the publishing agreement as of end of 2004. JMLR then went with Microtome, a small press that published JMLR annually, at a rather low subscription price.)</span>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>Announcing the JOURNAL of MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH</h3>
        <p>The Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) provides an international forum for the electronic and paper publication of high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of machine learning. JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers that contain:
          <ul>
            <li>new algorithms with empirical, theoretical, psychological, or biological justification;</li>
            <li>
              experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into the design and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;
            </li>
            <li>
              accounts of applications of existing techniques that shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the methods;</li>
            <li>
              formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new applications) and of methods for assessing performance on those tasks;</li>
            <li>
              development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical studies of practical learning methods;
            </li>
            <li>
              computational models of data from natural learning systems at the behavioral or neural level; or</li>
            <li>
              extremely well-written surveys of existing work.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            JMLR has a commitment to rigorous yet rapid reviewing; reviews are returned within six weeks of paper submission.  Final versions are published electronically immediately upon receipt, and an annual paper volume is published by MIT Press and sold to libraries and individuals. JMLR is accepting new submissions.  Please see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org">http://www.jmlr.org</a> for submission information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accepted papers, when published on the web, will be announced via an email list.  To subscribe, send an email message to majordomo@ai.mit.edu with body text "subscribe jmlr-announce" (without quotation marks).

      <span class="c1">In addition to finding the volunteers to run JMLR, work in 2000 focused on getting a first slate of strong papers lined up. This included both papers submitted to JMLR as well as some that were transferred from the Machine Learning Journal (upon the request of the respective authors). The first issue is available at <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v1/">https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v1/</a> and includes several papers co-hosted with www.kernel-machines.org, a website that partnered with JMLR to solicit submissions from the growing field of kernel methods.</span>

There had been discussions with Kluwer about pricey subscription fees and closed access. This culminated in a resignation of most of the editorial board of the journal in 2001 to join and endorse JMLR (<a href="http://sigir.org/files/forum/F2001/sigirFall01Letters.html">http://sigir.org/files/forum/F2001/sigirFall01Letters.html</a>, <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/statement.html">https://www.jmlr.org/statement.html</a>, see also Donald Knuth's letter at <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/joalet.pdf">https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/joalet.pdf</a>). Resignations started in July 2001, leading to discussions at a Dagstuhl workshop where several MLJ editorial board members were present (Bob Williamson, Manfred Warmuth, Chris Williams, Zoubin Ghahramani, Peter Bartlett, and Bernhard Schölkopf). As a result, JMLR invited all editorial board members of MLJ to also join JMLR. In August, Michael Jordan coordinated a letter announcing a joint resignation</span>

      <span class="c1">In 2007, there was a proposal by Cheng Soon Ong, Mikio Braun and Soeren Sonnenburg to start an open source software section of JMLR, accepting rolling submissions, much like the kernel machines section. The section started with a position paper written by Soeren et al.: <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/sonnenburg07a/sonnenburg07a.pdf">https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/sonnenburg07a/sonnenburg07a.pdf</a></span>

      <span class="c1">In late 2007, a committee was put together to find a successor for Leslie, identifying Lawrence Saul as the top candidate. He started to work alongside Leslie in mid 2008, and took over completely in 2009.</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">In late 2012, Leslie contacted Bernhard Schölkopf to take over as EiC. He argued that with the growth of the field, the job should be shared among two co-EiCs, and in March 2013, Kevin Murphy and him were announced as taking over from Lawrence Saul. They took turns month by month in assigning papers, and introduced a mechanism to make sure the queue gets cleared on time: each EiC needs to completely empty the queue at the beginning of the month. If one does not manage to do it on the 1st, then the queue continues to grow, so there is a strong incentive to do it on time..</span>

      <span class="c1">In June 2013, JMLR agreed to publish a special issue with papers from the new ICLR conference, with action editors Aaron Courville, Rob Fergus, and Christopher Manning. Later that year, a model was initiated where top tier conferences could have a 'JMLR track' directly accepting submissions into JMLR. This was subject to some conditions, e.g., that there is enough time for one round of revisions, and that the area chair handling the paper is also a JMLR AE.</span>

      <span class="c1">Ideas included a PLOS-ONE style journal connected to arxiv.org, a subsidiary that specializes in special issues, and a monthly issue which is a little less formal and more topical.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">But Kaelbling leads another revolution in her spare time. As editor of the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">upstart Journal of Machine Learning Research, Kaelbling offers some of the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">latest debates and developments in artificial intelligence to anyone with</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">access to the Internet - free. By contrast, the scholarly journals that</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">largely set the world's science agenda sometimes charge more than $1,000 a</span>

      <span class="c2">year for a subscription.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling would be just another quixotic idealist with her unpaid staff -</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">the journal "doesn't even have a bank account right now," she acknowledges -</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">resignations last month to join her crusade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling and her supporters argue that putting all top current research</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">online could well inspire crucial insights from people who wouldn't</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">otherwise have access; a statistician in Mongolia may spur the next</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">"The only thing we care about in the world is that people read our work,"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">The rivalry between Kaelbling's journal and Machine Learning - which costs</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">$1,050 a year for institutions and $120 for individuals - is part of a much</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">broader debate about how much scientific information should be free. For</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Genomics have locked horns repeatedly over Celera's plan to withhold some</span>

      <span class="c2">key information from the human genetic blueprint that could be sold to</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">pharmaceutical companies looking for potential new drugs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">More closely parallel to Kaelbling's work, the National Institutes of Health</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">have created a database called PubMed Central intended to allow anyone in</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">director and Nobel laureate Harold Varmus, pledged to boycott any journals</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">that didn't meet PubMed Central's standards for freely distributing data.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">The coalition backed off a little in early September, but the conflict still</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">looms.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">The free, Internet-based Journal of Machine Learning Research challenges an</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">elaborate system of disseminating scientific information that touches</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">everything from what appears on the nightly news to which researchers become</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">stars. A few well-known journals such as Science, Nature, and the New</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">England Journal of Medicine considerably influence scientific discussion and</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">have a near hammerlock on determining what science appears in the mainstream</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">press. A slew of others - including Machine Learning - shape their</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">respective subject areas, helping determine who gets tenure, where grants</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">go, and how their fields move forward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling and others note that the scientific community differs in several</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">ways from journalism, where support for free online access to magazines and</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">newspapers has withered. For one, most scientific authors don't get paid for</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">publishing, even in the journals with costly subscription prices. Instead,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">they receive their funding from universities, corporations, or government</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">grants, and publish mainly for prestige and to advance their fields.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling earns her salary from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">and part of her job description requires her to offer public service to the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">community, such as editing the Journal of Machine Learning Research.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Secondly, progress in any scientific field relies to a huge extent on the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">amount of available information. More available information equals more and</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">better science. Some of Kaelbling's colleagues, for example, want to design</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">robots that actually think like humans: Rodney Brooks, the director of</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Kaelbling's laboratory, helped inspire Steven Spielberg's vision for the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">movie "A.I." That enormously complicated task would be helped with input</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">from as many different scientists as possible. Putting everything online</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">seems like the obvious thing to do, Kaelbling argued.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Still, numerous scientists and publishers fear that moving away from</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">printed, subscription-based journals could derail standards and practices</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">that have worked well for years. Others fear that such a change could</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">shutter prestigious and important journals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">In the machine-learning community, swords have already crossed. In their</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">letter resigning from Machine Learning, the rebellious members, who</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">represented about two-thirds of the board, wrote: "Journals should</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">principally serve the needs of the intellectual community, in particular by</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">providing the immediate and universal access to journal articles that modern</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">technology supports, and doing so at a cost that excludes no one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">In the past, scholars in the field researched and wrote their articles,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">submitted them to Machine Learning, and then waited up to a year to see them</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">in print. Probably most aggravating to the authors, Machine Learning's</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">owners, Netherlands-based Kluwer Academic Publishers, retained complete</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">copyright control. Authors couldn't even publish their articles on personal</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Web pages - a fairly restrictive policy for the industry that the company</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">changed after the mass resignation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">With the Journal of Machine Learning Research, authors just e-mail their</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">pieces to Kaelbling, who then forwards them to assorted editors. These</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">volunteers, generally prestigious researchers in whatever particular</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">sub-field the article covers, then decide whether to accept or reject the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">articles. If accepted, the articles appear online immediately and the</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">authors retain full copyrights.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">"Mostly, it's just a bunch of work," said Kaelbling, before noting that she</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">still spends vastly more time with her MIT students and Erik the Red, a</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">robot resembling R2D2 that she is trying to teach to see and navigate</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">through hallways.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Despite Kaelbling's optimism, though, other scientists argue that there are</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">holes in her boat. Robert Holte, the editor of Machine Learning, supports</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">the new journal and suggests that both his journal and Kaelbling's can exist</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">harmoniously. But, he added, "What [the Journal of Machine Learning</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Research] doesn't have right now is a history. You can have the most famous</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">people on your editorial board that you like. But until a journal has a</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">well-established track record proving its ability to attract a large number</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">of high quality, highly-cited papers, it cannot claim to be the community's</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">flagship journal."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Tenure committees, for example, know that being published in Machine</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">Learning means you've accomplished something significant. Until it earns a</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">reputation, Kaelbling's journal could just be two crackpots in a barn with a</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">cable modem.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">In addition, advocates of print journals argue that online journals may not</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">hold to the same quality standards, becoming, in a sense, the scientific</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">equivalents of the Drudge Report.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">"Paper journals have a strict limit on the number of papers they can</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">publish. With an online journal, there's always a temptation to accept</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c2">rather than reject," said Cornell professor Shai Ben-David, one member of</span>

      <span class="c2">insists that it will maintain strict standards. "It's the same people doing</span>
